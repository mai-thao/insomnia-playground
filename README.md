# insomnia-playground
Learning about [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/get-started) API platform! This is where I will also version control my API endpoints for future reference.

All data and metadata of an Insomnia collection, document, or request can be [imported and exported](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/import-export-data) with ease! 
* This makes Insomnia reusable and portable so you can share with your team and they don't have to manually build it themselves. Insomnia also has a [Cloud Sync](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/insomnia-sync) feature so that might be another route instead of manually importing and exporting!
* Keep in mind that if you have secrets (API key, token, passwords, etc.), you should obfsucate them or exclude them during the export or store them in a separate environment file.
